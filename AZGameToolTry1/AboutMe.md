### Software Developer with a passion for fun in tech.

##### About AZGameTool

This portfolio application was created as an example of a tool for game development, and to see what the challenges and intricacies are for this kind of software. It was also nice being free and very practical with WPF, though I believe there is a lot to learn about App Sandboxing and Lifecycle Managment even when making traditional Win32 applications, hence the rather strict use MVVM or the relative lightweightness.

##### About the developer

I've been writing code for about 10 years now, plenty for firms and a lot for myself. Among these were more traditional applications for companies like Lufthansa Cargo, some Webdevelopment for Dm-drogerie markt, a one year stint as Microsoft Dynamics CRM developer for HDM, ENBW and more, two productivity/heath apps deployed on desktop and mobile for the windows stores 7 and up, and a HoloLens demo application for mixing bar drinks.
There are also a few game prototypes made with Unity and MonoGame/XNA, but nothing too grandiose.

It took a long time, but I feel ready to finally write Software for games. While writing B2B Software was necessecary for making a living, I first learned to write software so I can work in games after all.
With this I will make myself available to the market.

Feel free to contract me at omar@ajerray.de for feedback, inquiries, etc.

### Software Developer with a passion for fun in tech.

##### About AZGameToolTry1

this portfolio application was created as an example of a tool for game development, and to see what the challenges and intricacies are for software like this. It was also nice being free and very practical with WPF, though I believe there is a lot to learn about App Sandboxing and lifecycle managment even in traditional Win32 application, hence the rather strict use MVVM or the relative lightweightness.

##### About the developer

I've been writing code for about 10 years now, plenty for firms and plenty for myself. Among these were more traditional applications for companies like Lufthansa Cargo, some Webdevelopment for Dm-drogerie markt, a one year stint as dynCRM developer for HDM, ENBW and more, two productivity/heath apps deployed on desktop and mobile for the windows stores 7 and up, and a HoloLens demo application for mixing bar drinks.
There are also a few game prototypes made with Unit and MonoGame/XNA nothing too grandiose.

One dream of mine is being able to finally work on a few **babies**. Specifically work on, extend and perfect a few software products over a longer period of time rather than just a few months. This was denied me due to the necessecity of having to make a living which means less time for pet projects in favor of learning more technologies and fullfing contracted work.

I will write a few more pieces of software which I can then showcase for employment oppurtunities and and contract oppurtunities.

Feel free to contract me at omar@ajerray.de for feedback, inquiries, etc.
